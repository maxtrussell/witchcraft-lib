# Witchcraft Clojure Lib

Ideally the project structure will look like this. Once we can get the REPL to understand our project layout.
```
.
├── README.md
├── scripts
│   └── demo-house.clj
└── src
    └── net
        └── maxtrussell
            └── witchcraft
                └── witchcraft.clj
```
